This is a Logisim Evolution circuit that models a reduced instruction set computer (RISC-like). It includes a custom-designed Control Unit, ALU, Program Counter, RAM, and Register File, all connected to execute instruction words loaded in hexadecimal format. The system uses a simplified opcode structure to execute logical, arithmetic, memory, and branching instructions.
